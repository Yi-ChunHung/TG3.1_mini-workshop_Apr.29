# ğŸ§­ ftn58ToolBox

The tool box contains codes that improve quality of life while dealing with ftn58 or ftn58sparse. The codes are functions with their function be indicated either in their name or as their comments in second line.

## ğŸš© [RSPCD](./RSPCD)

The code plots the distribution of a wave function resolving to atoms.

## ğŸš© [RS_Hamiltonian](./RS_Hamiltonian.m)

The code tidies up the matrix elements of ftn58sparse for each translation.

## ğŸš© [Stn58sparse2ftn58](./Sftn58sparse2ftn58.m)

The code tranforms a Sftn58sparse into a ftn58.

## ğŸš© [check_onsite](./check_onsite.m)

The code displays the onsite energies of a ftn58sparse.

## ğŸš© [ftn58sparse2ftn58](./ftn58sparse2ftn58.m)

The code transforms a ftn58sparse into a ftn58.

## ğŸš© [ftn58sparse_transform_representation](./ftn58sparse_transform_representation.m)

The code transforms the representation of a ftn58sparse from Bloch representation to Wannier representation and vice versa.

## ğŸš© [non_repeat_ftn58sparse](./non_repeat_ftn58sparse.m)

The code makes a ftn58sparse to have a unique [ij,dd]. Using such a ftn58sparse can accelerate most codes in this repository.

## ğŸš© [readAinfo](./readAinfo.m)

The code displays the .Ainfo of a ftn58sparse as a table, which enables users to more efficiently access the information in .Ainfo.

## ğŸš© [reconstruct_ftn58spasre](./reconstruct_ftn58sparse.m)

The code removes orbitals and their related hoppings on given atoms in a ftn58spasre.
