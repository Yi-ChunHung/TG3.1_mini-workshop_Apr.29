Codes that would be shown to students who attend the second part of the mini-workshop in TG3.1 of NCTS physics at National Taiwan University on Apr. 29, 2022.

## ❓ [What do we need for a tight-binding Hamiltonian ?](./Tight-Binding-Model.pdf)

## ❓ [What else do we need to describe a material ?](./Info-for-material.pdf)

# 📂 [BandPlot](./BandPlot)

The folder contains codes that calculate and plot the band structure and partial charge distribution along a given k-path.

# 🧰 [ftn58ToolBox](./ftn58ToolBox)

The folder contains codes that improve quality-of-life while dealing with tight-binding models.

# 📁 [STBHmftn](./STBHmftn)

The program generates a slab with given surface normal through bulk tight-binding models.

# 📂 [TBGreenSur](./TBGreenSur)

The folder contains programs that calculate and plot the surface spectral weight of a tight-binding model by using real-space renormalization group through Green's function.

# 📁 [TBHmftn](./TBHmftn)

The program generates tight-binding model through a given tight-binding Hamiltonian or a _hr.dat file.
